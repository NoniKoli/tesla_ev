# tesla_ev

FiveM Electric Vehicle HUD, battery, charging, garage-charging

| WARNING: Work in progress! |
| --- |

This resource was created for demonstration purposes. Some features are basic, like `garagedemo`, and all scripts are client side.

In the future these may be integrated into frameworks and/or include their own server side/persistence logic.

## Requirements

 - [tesla_redis]
    - The `garagedemo/config.lua` offers the ability switch between in-memory (client) persistence and actual persistence using our [tesla_redis] library.
    - The default configuration is to use in-memory, but if you want to test out [tesla_redis], have a Redis server running on the same machine as the host.
    - Changing `Config.Garage.DB = DB.Client` to `Config.Garage.DB = DB.Redis` will switch the persitence method.
    - [tesla_redis] is in early development, currently expects the server to be at `127.0.0.1:6379`. The ability to configure [tesla_redis], and change this, is in the works. 

## tesla_ev

- EV HUD
    - EV vehicles display Whr (watt-hours) energy use
    - This figure is based on "RPMs" and Whr effects battery range
- EV Battery
    - EV vehicles have batteries instead of fuel
    - The battery discharge loosely follows real-life heuristics
        - A HUD is rendered on the minimap showing charge level %
        - Discharging uses a stepping function based on "RPM"
            - High RPMs (e.g. racing) will negatively effect range
            - Low RPMs benefit from less energy use
- EV Charger
    - Featuring the Tesla Supercharger 3D model
        - Via an included custom map: `tesla_supercharger`
    - Charging uses a quadratic Bezier curve
        - 0-60% takes ~30% of total charge time
        - &gt;61% takes the remaining time to reach full charge
    - Supports custom charging rates via `config.lua`
- Garage Demo
    - Mostly for demonstration purposes
    - Adds the concept of charging while your vehicle is stored in a garage
    - Supports custom charging rates via `config.lua`
        - Example: parking-garages charge faster than parking lots, which are faster than house-garages

## Download & Installation

This resource was developed alongside [tesla_modelx], [tesla_supercharger]. This resource works without them, but you might be interested in installing them altogether.

### Using Git
```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/boostvolt/tesla_ev [tesla]/tesla_ev/
git clone https://github.com/boostvolt/tesla_redis [tesla]/tesla_redis/

git clone https://github.com/boostvolt/tesla_modelx [tesla]/tesla_modelx/
git clone https://github.com/boostvolt/tesla_supercharger [tesla]/tesla_supercharger/
```

### Manually
- Download https://github.com/boostvolt/tesla_ev/archive/master.zip
- Create and place in in `[tesla]/tesla_ev` directory

## Installation
- Add this in your `server.cfg`:

```lua
start tesla_ev
-- if you downloaded related resources
start tesla_modelx
start tesla_supercharger
```

## Debug
- Debug commands available when `Config.Debug = True`
- `/modelx` spawns and places you in the Tesla Model X
- `/charge 40` will set fuel to specified amount (40 as an example)
